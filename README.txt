A web-app version of the murder-mystery game A night in Palermo (aka Mafia) where players become different characters inhabiting the town of Palermo and try to stop a group of criminals for getting away with murder.
Built on Javascript/jQuery front-end and python (flask-socketio) backend. 

Mostly works as intended though further play-testing required.
